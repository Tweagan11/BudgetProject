# BudgetProject

This project was a weekend project to better categorize and automate my bank statements. I hate having to manually upload each and every transaction into google sheets. So, I learned a litte more about Gspread, a python package that helps connect to google spreadsheets, and was able to automate it reading each of the CSV files I can grab from my banks. It filters how it reads it based on the file name, so that it consistently gives me accurate information.
